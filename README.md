# Portfolio

Front end of my portfolio site.

Aim is to write entire portfolio in Rust as a learning experience

Tech Used
- Rust
- Leptos framework


## Client Side Rendering

To run it as a client-side app, you can issue `trunk serve --open` in the root. This will build the entire app into one CSR bundle.
